The ELBA-LAMMPS toolkit is a package containing tools and examples to facilitate the simulation of the [ELBA](http://www.orsi.sems.qmul.ac.uk/elba/index.html) force field with the massively-parallel molecular dynamics software [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov).

To get started, download the **latest** (current) version (see [Downloads](https://code.google.com/p/elba-lammps/downloads/list)) and follow the guidelines in the README files in the various (sub)folders.

While all past versions of ELBA-LAMMPS are available for reference, it is highly recommended to keep up-to-date with the latest (current) version, as this is likely to be "the best version" (more complete, efficient, user-friendly, bug-free, up-to-date with LAMMPS).

The ELBA coarse-grain force field is described in the following papers:
